Arcade Gannon is a nice scientist/doctor who joined a group called the followers of the apocalypse (a group full of doctors and scientists) to help the less fortunate. He believes in helping New Vegas be independent of all outside factions so it can become something great, and absolutely hates the legion for all the atrocities they’ve committed. He’s also homosexual. And then there’s the legion. A group of fascist, power hungry, culture-destroying a-holes who also hate homosexuality as it gets in the way of breeding. In the quest et tumor brute the leader of the Legion Caesar has cancer and needs the main character to cure it (you can also kill him but that’s not important) an option is to sell Arcade Gannon a possible follower for your adventures to Caesar. One of the most dark things you can do in the fallout universe in my opinion',\n",

So he gives you a fake note written by \"finn\" to which you give it to the woman that loves finn and it talks about how she\\'ll be a stay at home mom and do cooking and laundry all day. She then despises finn, finn now losing a love interest and a friend, while the dark elf comes by to take her away. It is great',\n",

(SPOILER ALERT for fallout new vegas with the quest et tumor brute!) Don’t read this if you don’t want spoilers for the main quests for the legion. Arcade Gannon is a nice scientist/doctor who joined a group called the followers of the apocalypse (a group full of doctors and scientists) to help the less fortunate. He believes in helping New Vegas be independent of all outside factions so it can become something great, and absolutely hates the legion for all the atrocities they’ve committed. He’s also homosexual. And then there’s the legion. A group of fascist, power hungry, culture-destroying a-holes who also hate homosexuality as it gets in the way of breeding. In the quest et tumor brute the leader of the Legion Caesar has cancer and needs the main character to cure it (you can also kill him but that’s not important) an option is to sell Arcade Gannon a possible follower for your adventures to Caesar. One of the most dark things you can do in the fallout universe in my opinion',\n",
